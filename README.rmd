# Awesome CV in R

This CV was made using the [`vitae`](https://pkg.mitchelloharawild.com/vitae/) package in R, and a great deal of inspiration from [Dominique Makowski's template](https://github.com/DominiqueMakowski/CV). Please give them due credit if using this template. I also brought some optimization and documentation to the current template, so acknowledgement would be appreciated, though it is totally optional.

## Instructions

- The main file to edit is `cv.Rmd`. Use it to add your name, contact information, and description. Change the template colour using the `headcolor` parameter.
- Request a short version by setting `short` to `TRUE`.
- Make sure to install the required packages.
- Specify your Google Scholar profile number and name if using this feature.
- Change the order of sections by changing the order of code chunks.
- Edit the individual files ("childs") to edit the content as desired (e.g., `publications.Rmd`).
- Add `eval = !short` to code chunk options to make them optional for the short version

## Notes

- This template uses the North-American 8.5in x 11in (letter) size instead of the original European 8.27 x 11.69 (A4) size.
- Special characters (e.g., `$`, `&`, `%`, need to be escaped with a backslash or a double backslash)
- The template uses some LaTeX language at times for specific customization (commands starting with backslashes `\`). Some useful commands include:
  - `\\pagebreak` to create a page break between sections
  - `\\textit{yourtext}` to italicize `yourtext` (within dataframes, outside of regular rmarkdown)
  - `\\hspace{0.5cm}` to create some left space (e.g., between columns)
  - `\\dotfill` to create dot lines
  - `\scriptsize` to make text smaller (typically for publications sections)
  - `\normalsize` to make text normal (for regular sections)
  - `\setlength{\parindent}{-0.2in}` and `\setlength{\leftskip}{0.2in}` to indent publication "hanging" style.
- For questions or difficulties, feel free to open a GitHub issue here.
