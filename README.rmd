# Awesome CV in R

This CV was made using the [`vitae`](https://pkg.mitchelloharawild.com/vitae/) package in R, and using the template from [Dominique Makowski](https://github.com/DominiqueMakowski/CV) (which includes the code for the Google Scholar figure and table, and a lot more). Please give them due credit if using this template. I also brought some optimization and documentation to the current template, so acknowledging me would be appreciated, though totally optional.

## Instructions

- The main file to edit is `cv.Rmd`. Use it to add your name, contact information, and description. Change the template colour using the `headcolor` parameter.
- Request a short version by setting `short` to `TRUE`.
- Make sure to install all required packages.
- Specify your Google Scholar profile number and name if using this feature.
- Change the order of sections by changing the order of code chunks.
- Edit the individual files ("childs") to edit your sections' content as desired (e.g., `publications.Rmd`).
- Add `eval = !short` to code chunk options to make them optional for the short version.
- To output the CV to PDF, simply Knit the file `cv.Rmd` (through RStudio's button or the Ctr+Shift+K shortcut)

## Notes

- If you are using a word processor as well as RStudio, one tip to save time is to change the relevant content section (e.g., `publications.Rmd`) from `Source` to `Visual` (top left in RStudio) before copy-pasting your publications and other formatted content. This way, all the existing formatting (bold, italic, etc.) will be kept and you won't have to manually recreate all the formatting.
- This template uses the North-American `8.5in x 11in` (letter) size instead of the original European `8.27 x 11.69` (A4) size.
- Special characters (e.g., `$`, `&`, `%`, need to be escaped with a backslash or a double backslash)
- The template uses some LaTeX language at times for specific customization (commands starting with backslashes `\`). Some useful commands include:
  - `\pagebreak` to create a page break between sections
  - `\scriptsize` to make text smaller (typically for publications sections)
  - `\normalsize` to make text normal (for regular sections)
  - `\\textit{yourtext}` to italicize `yourtext` (within dataframes, outside of regular rmarkdown)
  - `\\hspace{0.5cm}` to create some left space (e.g., between columns in tables)
  - `\\dotfill` to create dotted lines (e.g., for the award section)
  - `\setlength{\parindent}{-0.2in}` and `\setlength{\leftskip}{0.2in}` to indent publications, "hanging" style.
